# DL-hw1
## Homework -  neural net supervised learning.
This project was realized alongside this [guide](https://colab.research.google.com/github/google/eng-edu/blob/main/ml/cc/exercises/intro_to_neural_nets.ipynb#scrollTo=tsfE4ujDL4ju).
Regressor implementation over the [dataset `insurance.csv`](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance). Dataset includes input values, i.e. features:
- `age`,
- `sex`,
- `bmi`,
- `children`,
- `smoker`,
- `region'
also it contains target values `charges`.

Executed structures in this implementation were:
- Basic artificial neural network,
- Deep neural network / MLP,
- RandomForestRegressor,
- DNN with Dropout functionality.
